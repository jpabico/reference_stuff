// Assuming you have the HTML below and jQuery available, please write the JavaScript that
//  *    makes it so that when the button is clicked, the background color of the div changes to
//  *    the next color in this array: ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'indigo', 'violet'].
//  *    Each successive click should then move to the next color, and after one full cycle through the
//  *    array, it should begin again at the first color in the array. However, these color changes
//  *    should be throttled so that it can only be changed 0.5 seconds or later after the last change.

//  * Available HTML:
//  *   <div id="main">Main Div</div>
//  *   <button id="button">Rainbow Time!</button>
//  */
