# simulate rolling two dice and finding the sum

# pseudocode - plan of attack
# define class for one die 
# give die some properties (ex. 6 sides represented by integers 1-6)
# give die a roll method to achieve 1 of 6 outcomes
# instantiate two dice objects
# call roll method on each die 
# write a sum method to find the total
