# Conway's Game of Life

# rules of game

# each cell has 8 neighbors
# any live cell with 0 or 1 live neighbors will die (underpopulation)
# any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors will live to next generation
# any live cell with more than 3 live neighbors will die (overpopulation)
# any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors will become alive (reproduction)
