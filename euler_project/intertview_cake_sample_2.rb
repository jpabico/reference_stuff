# Problem: given an array of integers, write a functions that finds the product of every integer except the integer at that index. 
# Example: given a = [1, 7, 3, 4],  the function would return [84, 12, 28, 21] by calculating [7*3*4, 1*3*4, 1*7*4, 1*7*3]
# Additional notes: do not use division in the soultion
