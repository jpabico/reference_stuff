Here are my notes about APIs from when I first started learning about this stuff...
        HTTP = HyperText Transfer Protocol
        ...it's a fancy way of saying "rules for getting something from one place to another"
        ...in this case, the rules are for transferring web pages to your browser

sample js file that requests information from a server...

var xhr = new XMLHttpRequesy();
xhr.open("GET", "http://www.codeacademy.com/", false);
xhr.send();

console.log(xhr.status);
console.log(xhr.statusText);

this request returns 200 / OK

we can use HTTP to grab info from just about any web page on the internet. these pages come from servers.

clients make an HTTP request.  The server sends a response back.

This client/server relationship is a prerequisite of a set of principles called REST 

Representational State Transfer

Whenever you navigate through a site by clicking links, you're making a state transition, which brings you to the next page (representing the next state of the app) - that's it!

by following this simple model of clicking from page to page, you're starting to follow REST principles.  (Restful)

API (application programming interface) = specifies the ways a program can interact with an application.  fro example, if you want to write a program that reads and analyzes dara from twitter, you'd need to use the twitter api, which would specify the process for authentication, imporant URLs, classes, methods and so on.
For an API or web service to be RESTful, it must do the following:
- separate the client from the server
- not hold state between requests (meaning that all the information necessary to respond to a request is available in each individual request)...no data (or state) is held by the server from request to request
- use http and http methods (see below)
