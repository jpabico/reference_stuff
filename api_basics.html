Here are my notes about APIs from when I first started learning about this stuff...
        HTTP = HyperText Transfer Protocol
        ...it's a fancy way of saying "rules for getting something from one place to another"
        ...in this case, the rules are for transferring web pages to your browser

sample js file that requests information from a server...

var xhr = new XMLHttpRequesy();
xhr.open("GET", "http://www.codeacademy.com/", false);
xhr.send();

console.log(xhr.status);
console.log(xhr.statusText);

this request returns 200 / OK

we can use HTTP to grab info from just about any web page on the internet. these pages come from servers.

clients make an HTTP request.  The server sends a response back.

This client/server relationship is a prerequisite of a set of principles called REST 

Representational State Transfer

Whenever you navigate through a site by clicking links, you're making a state transition, which brings you to the next page (representing the next state of the app) - that's it!

by following this simple model of clicking from page to page, you're starting to follow REST principles.  (Restful)

API (application programming interface) = specifies the ways a program can interact with an application.  fro example, if you want to write a program that reads and analyzes dara from twitter, you'd need to use the twitter api, which would specify the process for authentication, imporant URLs, classes, methods and so on.
For an API or web service to be RESTful, it must do the following:
- separate the client from the server
- not hold state between requests (meaning that all the information necessary to respond to a request is available in each individual request)...no data (or state) is held by the server from request to request
- use http and http methods (see below)

4 HTTP verbs...GET (read), POST (create), PUT (update), DELETE (destroy)


anatomy of a request - made up of 3 parts

request line - tells the server what kind of request is being sent (GET, POST, etc) and what resource it's looking for

header - sends the server additional info (e.g. which client is making the request)

body - empty (GET request) or contains data (POST, PUT)

// POST /codecademy/learn-http HTTP/1.1     ...request line
// Host: www.codecademy.com                         ...header
// Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

// Name=Eric&Age=26                                     ...data

endpoints are API-defined locations where particular data are stored.  You'll GET something different different depending on the endpoint you use.

for example, if you're using the API for a video hosting service, there might be endpoints for the most popular videos, the most recent videos, or videos belonging to a certain category, etc

many APIs require an API key that grants you access to a particular API.  the key identifies you to the API, which helps the API provider keep track of how their service is used and prevent unauthorized/malicious activity

some APIs require authentication using a protocol called OAuth

API keys are long/alphanumeric

a successful request to the server results in a response which is the message the server sends back to the client (you!)

the response from the server will contain a 3-digit status code

anatomy of a response

response line = includes 3-digit HTTP status code
header = includes information about the server and its response
body = contains the text of the response

parsing (or analyzing) XML (extensible markup language)

as long as you document the structure of your API's response, other people can use your API to get information

JSON is an alternative to XML.

let's use this information to use the YouTube API
