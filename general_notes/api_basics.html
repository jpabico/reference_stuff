    <h1>API Notes</h1>

    <p> My notes about APIs from when I first started learning about this stuff...</p>

    <ul>
        <li> HTTP = HyperText Transfer Protocol.  It's a fancy way of saying "rules for getting something from one place to another".</li>

        <li>Clients make an HTTP request.  The server sends back a response.</li>
        
        <li>Navigating through a site by clicking links brings you to the next page (representing the next state of the app - a state transition).  By following this model of clicking from page to page, you're starting to follow REST (Representational State Transfer) principles(see below).</li>

        <li>API (application programming interface) specify ways a program can interact with an app (e.g. a program that reads/analyzes data from Twitter uses the Twitter API, which would specify the process for authentication, imporant URLs, classes, methods, etc).</li>

        <li>API endpoints are locations where particular data are stored (e.g. an API for a video hosting service might have endpoints for the most popular videos, the most recent videos, or videos belonging to a certain category).</li>

        <li>Some APIs require an API key that grants access and identifies the to the API, which helps the API provider keep track of how their service is used and prevent unauthorized/malicious activity.  Some APIs require authentication using a protocol called OAuth. </li>

        <li>RESTful APIs and web services:
            <ol>
                <li>separate the client from the server</li>
                <li>do not hold state between requests (i.e. all the info needed to respond to a request is available in each individual request - no data or state is held by the server from request to request)</li>
                <li>use http and http methods (4 HTTP Verbs): GET (read), POST (create), PUT (update), and DELETE (destroy)</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>The Request...
            <ol>
                <li>request line - tells the server what kind of request is being sent (GET, POST, etc) and what resource it's looking for</li>
                <li>header - additional info (e.g. which client is making the request)</li>
                <li>body - empty (GET request) or contains data (POST, PUT)</li>
            </ol>
        </li>  

        <li>The Response...
            <ol>
                <li>response line - includes 3-digit HTTP status code</li>
                <li>header - includes info about the server and its response</li>
                <li>body - contains the text of the response</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>As long as the structure of the API's response is documented, other people can use the API to get info.</li>

        <li>Response data needs to be parsed (analyzed).  Often sent as XML or JSON.</li>

         <li>Examples of Useful / Popular APIs:
            <ul>
                <li>Twitter</li>
                <li>YouTube</li>
                <li>GoogleMaps</li>
                <li>PayPal</li>
                <li>GitHub</li>
                <li>Facebook</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
