    <h1>System Design Problems</h1>
    <p>Step-by-step approach:
        <ol> 
            <li><strong>Make Believe</strong> - If all the data could fit on 1 machine and there were no memory limitations, how could the problem be solved?</li>
            <li><strong>Get Real</strong> - How much data can one actually fit on a machine? What problems arise when data is split up?  Determine how to divide the data and how a machine would identify where to look up a different piece of data.</li>
            <li><strong>Propose a Solution</strong> - Just like it sounds...</li>
        </ol>

        Most companies use large systems of interconnected machines.  It's helpful to have a ballpark figure of how much data a computer can store (hard drive space, RAM, internet transfer latency, etc).

        Common strategies for dividing up data include...
